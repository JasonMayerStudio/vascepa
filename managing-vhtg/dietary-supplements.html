                            <h4><strong>Myths/truths regarding omega-3 dietary supplements</strong></h4>
                            <p><strong>MYTH:</strong> Fish oil is natural and therefore safe.<sup>5-13,15-17</sup></p>
                            <p><strong>TRUTH:</strong> Natural does not necessarily mean safe. Safety and tolerability of prescription products are investigated in well-controlled clinical trials, which are reviewed and approved by the FDA. Dietary supplement manufacturers are not required to test their products or gain approval from the FDA before distribution; therefore, the relative safety of these products is unknown.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <p><strong>MYTH:</strong> Benefit and safety claims for fish oil have been studied in robust FDA-reviewed clinical studies.<sup>3,4</sup></p>
                            <p><strong>TRUTH:</strong> Only prescription drugs are subject to FDA-reviewed clinical studies, which evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product. Manufacturers of dietary supplements are not required to test for safety or submit trial data to substantiate efficacy claims prior to distribution.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <p><strong>MYTH:</strong> Low-dose use of omega-3 fatty acids has proven benefit for adult health.<sup>4-12</sup></p>
                            <p><strong>TRUTH:</strong> Low doses (eg, 1 g/d) of omega-3 fatty acids have repeatedly been shown to have little effect on key lipid parameters. Due to the lack of head-to-head trials, it is not known if dietary supplement intake can achieve a therapeutic level of omega-3 fatty acid. An attempt to take 4 g/d of EPA orally from dietary supplements may require taking more than 10 capsules per day, which may result in increased caloric intake and potential risk of adverse events; such risks have not been evaluated in FDA-reviewed trials.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <p><strong>MYTH:</strong> Fish oil capsules purchased as a dietary supplement are a less expensive option than higher purity, FDA-approved prescription therapy.<sup>5-12</sup></p>
                            <p><strong>TRUTH:</strong> Because many fish oil supplements contain such low amounts of omega-3, the cost to achieve a higher dose of EPA (eg, 4 g/d) exceeds the typical cost of a prescription. For patients with commercial insurance, VASCEPA is available for as little as $9<sup>&#8225;</sup> per monthly fill with the VASCEPA Savings Card.</p>
